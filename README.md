This is my mini project for the Student Database Management System.  
It is a console-based Java application where we can add students, view student records, update information, and delete students using a MySQL database. I created a simple menu-based program where everything works through the console, and the data is stored in the database.

To run this project, we need to set up a MySQL database and create a table named "students". I have already tested the program, and it connects to the database successfully. After running the StudentApp.java file, you can choose options like adding a student, updating a student, viewing all students, or deleting a student.

This project was created as part of my coursework, and the full source code is uploaded here. Please open the StudentApp.java file to run the program. All the database setup and code are included so it can be tested easily.
